## Overview
For our research endeavor, we set out to investigate the correlation between  UFO sightings  and a diverse range of contributing factors such as Year and Shape, Light Pollution, Legality of Cannabis, Starbucks locations, and Latitude. Analyzing UFO sightings can pinpoint trends and patterns which will enable  us to better understand the mysteries in our universe and our place in it.

**ABOUT:**
  - This is an interactive web page to to visualize UAP reports.
  - The GeoJSON Summary includes all reports that  goes back 100+ years.
  - Using a visual map of UAP sightings can help to understand sighting phenomona and trends.
  - Options to filter sightings based on their shapes and years will also provide a more in depth understanding of UAP phenomona.

**Ethical Considerations**
- We made all effort to ensure the data we retrieved and used was made available from open sources. We inspected data sites to seek any warnings or disclaimers made by the authors and/or publishers of the dataset for any requests to not scrape their data. We respected any such requests we came across upon and seeked alternative data sources.
