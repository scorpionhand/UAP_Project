Custom- This contains all data I could find on the legalization of medicinal and recreational cannabis using the Wikipedia page on the subject as my main guide. Almost all my sources in this table come from that page. I could not find any sources regarding the legalization of medicinal cannabis in Ohio, as the digital library containing this information is not accessible at this time. If the date of first sales could not be found, I used the date the law in question went into effect, and if I could find neither, I used the date the law in question was approved or signed. I also included data on the legal amount of medicinal/recreational cannabis for each state that allows such. Please keep in mind that I tried finding sources that contained the most information, and that not all the sources contain all the information. In these cases, I used the aforementioned Wikipedia page, as well as Wikipedia pages on cannabis in each individual state, to verify the information my sources did not include.

Wikipedia- This table comes directly from the Wikipedia page regarding the legality of Cannabis by U.S. jurisdiction. It only contains data on recreational cannabis, does not cite any sources, and only includes columns on dates relevant laws went into effect, dates licensed sales of cannabis began, and the means by which cannabis was legalized. Keep in mind that the page this table comes from is the same one I mentioned at the start of the custom paragraph.
